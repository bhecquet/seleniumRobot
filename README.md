# SeleniumTestsFramework

Selenium Tests Framework (referred as STF from here on) is a test automation framework for automated testing of Desktop web, mobile site and mobile apps. STF is based on WebDriver, Appium, TestNG and Maven. 
Refer STF [How-To guide](https://github.com/TestingForum/seleniumtestsframework/wiki) to learn more about STF features. 

Please **Notice That** If you are looking for a sample project which uses STF then you should rather clone [seleniumtests](https://github.com/TestingForum/seleniumtests) project and not this project. [seleniumtests](https://github.com/TestingForum/seleniumtests) uses STF and demonstrates its features.

Have a question or feature request? post it in [Testing Forum](http://www.seleniumtests.com/p/testing-forum.html) :-)
